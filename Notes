WEBPACK: 
    1.webpack means bundle of modules or popular module bundler ,it is a toll for build application .
            1.module means combination or group of components and services ..etc..
    2.whenever webpack  process our application internally dependency graph will generate from entry points then it will combine our total modules into one file.

    3.In webapck there are 4 important elements are there
        1.Entry point
            1.entry point indicates which module webpack should use to start our application build
            2.in this we have to give path of entry point file
                ex-

        2.Loaders
            1.handles our types of files by using loaders
        3.plugins
        4.output
        5.mode



Configuration:
    
    step1:
        1.first we have to create package.json
            npm init -y 
                1.it will create package.json for our application

        2.we have to install webpack into our project from cli
            npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

    step2:
        1.here we have to create a file in folder structure i.e webpack.config.js
        2.now in that file write module.exports object
        3.we have to give entrypoint path here

    step 3:
        1. so here create a module object in that create rules array in that we have to configure of loaders , svg , css and babel loaders.
            link for loaders--- npmjs.com

        2.in that link we have to import svg-inline-loader so search this loader in that and install itin project cli
            npm install svg-inline-loader --save-dev
                1.after installation and copy paste that configuration into your modules  in webpack.config.js

        3.import the css loader 
            npm install --save-dev  css-loader style-loader
                1.copy the configuration 

        4.import babel loader 
            npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env webpack
                1.if we want to use advance java script concepts in webpack so we have to import babel loaders
                    {
                        test:/\.(js)$/,
                        use:"babel-loader
                    }

    step:4
        1.now we have to give output path before that we have to import path in webpack.config.js
            const path = require('path')
        2.now output path is
            output : {
                path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
                filename: "our output filename" ex--" bundle.js"
            }                    
        
    step5:

        1.In angular whenever you did ng serve --open command internally angular create 5 files like    
            1.runtime.js
            2.vendor.js
            3.style.js
            4.main.js
            5.

        2.so here we created some files finally that all files bundle in bundle.js so we have to inject this file into index.html so we  need to use html-plugin
                npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
                 1.copy configurtion
                 2.import plugin in that file

        3. it will create index.html file and it injects our outputfile into this inde.html file

    step6:
        1.we have to install webpack server
            npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev

        2.need to import mode
            mode : process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "production" : " development"

    step7:
        1.update package.json

        2.in scripts 
             "start": "webpack --mode development",
             "build": "NODE_ENV='production' webpack", 

        3.create folder which given in entrypoint path
            1. create index.js
            2.in that print array

    step8:
        1.now run command npm start
            1.it will look in pacakage.json---webpack----entrypoint.js---it will open file----it will look at each loaders nd handles it----it will create bundle.js and index.html

        2.in bundle.js output will come
